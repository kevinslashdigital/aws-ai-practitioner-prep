- **What it is**: A fully managed service that gives you access to **foundation models (FMs)** from top providers like Anthropic (Claude), Meta (Llama), AI21, Cohere, and Stability AI.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Text generation, summarization, Q&A
  - Image generation (e.g., with Stability AI)
- **Key Features**:
  - No need to manage infrastructure
  - Supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Guardrails and observability tools

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
- **What it is**: A tool within SageMaker that provides access to pre-built models and example notebooks for **text, vision, and code generation**.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Fine-tuning open-source models
  - Experimenting with Hugging Face and PyTorch models
- **Key Features**:
  - Pre-built solutions
  - No ML expertise required to get started

---

## üß™ PartyRock (Amazon Bedrock Playground)
- **What it is**: A **no-code/low-code playground** built on Bedrock that lets you quickly prototype generative AI apps with drag-and-drop tools.
