# ✅ Factors for Selecting Appropriate Generative AI Models

Choosing the right generative AI model depends on several technical, business, and regulatory considerations. Below are key factors to evaluate:

---

## 🧠 Model Types
- **Definition**: Select the model architecture that aligns with your data type and task.
- **Examples**:
  - Text: GPT, Claude, LLaMA
  - Image: Stable Diffusion, DALL·E
  - Multi-modal: Gemini, GPT-4 (text + image)

---

## 📈 Performance Requirements
- **Definition**: Assess how fast, accurate, and scalable the model needs to be.
- **Considerations**:
  - Response time (latency)
  - Token generation speed
  - Throughput for concurrent users
- **Trade-off**: Larger models often perform better but are slower and costlier.

---

## 🧩 Capabilities
- **Definition**: Determine if the model supports the features your application needs.
- **Examples**:
  - Can it follow instructions (instruction tuning)?
  - Does it support multi-turn conversation memory?
  - Can it generate code, translate, or summarize?

---

## 🚧 Constraints
- **Definition**: Understand the limitations that could impact implementation.
- **Types**:
  - Hardware: GPU/CPU availability
  - Budget: Cost per 1,000 tokens or API usage fees
  - Size: Model size affects deployment (edge vs. cloud)

---

## 📜 Compliance & Security
- **Definition**: Ensure the model complies with organizational and legal standards.
- **Examples**:
  - Data privacy (GDPR, HIPAA)
  - Content filtering or moderation
  - Explainability requirements in regulated industries

---

## 🔁 Customizability
- **Definition**: Evaluate whether the model can be fine-tuned or customized.
- **Options**:
  - Out-of-the-box (zero-shot/few-shot)
  - Fine-tuned with domain-specific data
  - Embedding + RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)

---

## 🔒 Hosting & Deployment Model
- **Definition**: Choose how and where the model will run.
- **Options**:
  - Fully managed API (e.g., AWS Bedrock, OpenAI)
  - Self-hosted on cloud or edge
  - On-premise for sensitive data

---

## 💬 Language and Region Support
- **Definition**: Ensure the model supports the target languages and complies with local data handling laws.
- **Examples**:
  - Khmer, Japanese, or multilingual capabilities
  - Region-specific data residency requirements
