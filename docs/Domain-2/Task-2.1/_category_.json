    "description": "This content provides a comprehensive overview of generative AI, explaining its foundational concepts (like tokens, embeddings, and transformers), highlighting its wide range of use cases (from image and audio generation to chatbots and recommendation engines), and detailing the lifecycle of foundation modelsâ€”from data selection and pre-training to deployment and continuous improvement. It emphasizes how generative AI leverages large-scale models and prompt engineering to create intelligent systems across modalities, while requiring thoughtful evaluation, monitoring, and feedback to ensure relevance, fairness, and adaptability in real-world applications."
