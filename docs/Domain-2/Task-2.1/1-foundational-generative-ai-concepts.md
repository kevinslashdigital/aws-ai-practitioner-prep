# 🧠 Foundational Generative AI Concepts

Understanding these core terms will help you build a solid foundation in generative AI:

---

## 🧩 Tokens
- **Definition**: The smallest units of text that a model can understand — often words, parts of words, or characters.
- **Example**: The sentence "I love AI." may be split into tokens like `["I", "love", "AI", "."]`.

---

## 📦 Chunking
- **Definition**: Splitting large documents into manageable pieces or "chunks" for processing or embedding.
- **Purpose**: Helps with memory limits and improves relevance in retrieval tasks.
- **Example**: A 10-page article might be chunked into 500-word segments.

---

## 📌 Embeddings
- **Definition**: Numerical representations of text (or images) that capture meaning and relationships.
- **Use Case**: Power semantic search and clustering.
- **Example**: "car" and "automobile" have similar embeddings (vectors close together).

---

## 🧭 Vectors
- **Definition**: Multi-dimensional numeric arrays representing embedded data.
- **Use Case**: Used in vector databases and similarity comparisons.
- **Example**: Text converted to `[0.12, 0.75, -0.33, ...]` for machine understanding.

---

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering
- **Definition**: Crafting input text (prompts) to guide LLM output.
- **Goal**: Get accurate, relevant, or creative responses from the model.
- **Example**: “Summarize this article in 3 bullet points.”

---

## 🔁 Transformer-Based LLMs
- **Definition**: Large Language Models built using the transformer architecture.
- **Core Idea**: Use attention mechanisms to understand context across long text spans.
- **Popular Models**: GPT-4, BERT, Claude, Falcon.

---

## 🏗️ Foundation Models
- **Definition**: Large, pre-trained models trained on broad data and adaptable to many tasks.
- **Examples**: GPT, LLaMA, Claude.
- **Traits**: General-purpose, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks (e.g., summarization, code generation).

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Multi-Modal Models
- **Definition**: Models that handle and combine **multiple data types** (text, image, audio).
- **Examples**: GPT-4 (text + image), Gemini, Flamingo.
- **Use Case**: Image captioning, audio transcription, visual Q&A.

---

## 🌫️ Diffusion Models
- **Definition**: A type of generative model used in image generation (like Stable Diffusion).
- **How It Works**: Start with noise and gradually remove it to create realistic outputs.
- **Example**: Generating photorealistic images from text prompts.
