# Understanding Model Performance and Business Metrics

When evaluating a machine learning (ML) model, it‚Äôs important to look at two types of metrics:

- **Model performance metrics** ‚Äì How well the model works from a technical point of view.
- **Business metrics** ‚Äì How well the model adds value to the business.

Both are necessary to measure the real success of an ML solution.

## üìä Model Performance Metrics

These metrics measure the **technical quality** of your model ‚Äî how accurately it makes predictions.

### ‚úÖ Accuracy
**What it is:**  
The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

**Formula:**  
`(Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)`

**When to use:**  
Best when classes are balanced (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

---

### üß™ Precision
**What it is:**  
The proportion of predicted positives that are actually correct.

**Formula:**  
`True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`

**Use case:**  
Important when **false positives** are costly (e.g., spam filters).

---

### üîç Recall (Sensitivity)
**What it is:**  
The proportion of actual positives that the model correctly identified.

**Formula:**  
`True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`

**Use case:**  
Important when **false negatives** are costly (e.g., disease detection).

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è F1 Score
**What it is:**  
The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances both metrics.

**Formula:**  
`2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

**Use case:**  
Best when you need a balance between precision and recall.

---

### üìà AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
**What it is:**  
Measures how well the model can distinguish between classes.

**Scale:**  
0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect model

**Use case:**  
Great for evaluating binary classifiers, especially with imbalanced datasets.

---

### üìâ Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
**What it is:**  
Used in regression tasks to measure the average error between predicted and actual values.

**Use case:**  
Predicting continuous values (e.g., price, temperature).

---

## üíº Business Metrics

These metrics evaluate whether the model delivers **business value** and aligns with company goals.

### üíµ Cost Per User
**What it is:**  
How much it costs to serve each user using the ML solution.

**Use case:**  
Used to manage infrastructure or API costs in scalable apps.

---

### üì¶ Development Cost
**What it is:**  
Time, labor, and infrastructure cost required to build, test, and deploy the ML model.

**Use case:**  
Helps evaluate whether the model is worth building in-house vs. using a pre-trained model or third-party service.

---

### üì£ Customer Feedback
**What it is:**  
User satisfaction, complaints, and suggestions after deploying the ML feature.

**Use case:**  
Measures how well the model improves user experience (e.g., chatbot helpfulness, recommendation relevance).

---

### üìà Return on Investment (ROI)
**What it is:**  
Measures the financial gain from using the model compared to the cost of developing and maintaining it.

**Formula:**  
`(Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs`

**Use case:**  
Used by stakeholders to justify continued investment in ML.
