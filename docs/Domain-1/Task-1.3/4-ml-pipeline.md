# AWS Services for Each Stage of the Machine Learning (ML) Pipeline

AWS offers a wide range of services to support each step of the ML lifecycle — from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring.

---

## 📥 1. Data Collection

**Purpose:** Gather and store raw data from various sources.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon S3** – Store structured and unstructured data at scale.
- **AWS Glue** – Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from multiple sources.
- **Amazon Kinesis** – Ingest streaming data in real-time (e.g., IoT, logs).
- **AWS Data Exchange** – Access third-party data for ML.

---

## 📊 2. Data Preparation & Exploration

**Purpose:** Clean, explore, and understand the data.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler** – Visual tool for data pre-processing, transformation, and exploration.
- **AWS Glue DataBrew** – Low-code data cleaning and transformation.
- **Amazon Athena** – Query data in S3 using SQL for quick exploration.
- **Amazon QuickSight** – Create dashboards and visual data summaries.

---

## 🧹 3. Feature Engineering

**Purpose:** Create and transform features that improve model performance.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Feature Store** – Centralized store for creating, storing, and sharing features across teams and models.
- **SageMaker Processing Jobs** – Run custom scripts for feature creation using Python, Spark, etc.
- **AWS Lambda** – Run lightweight, serverless feature transformation on-demand.

---

## 🧠 4. Model Training

**Purpose:** Train ML models using selected algorithms and data.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Training Jobs** – Scalable infrastructure for distributed training.
- **Amazon SageMaker Autopilot** – Automatically trains and tunes the best model with AutoML.
- **Amazon SageMaker Studio** – An integrated IDE for custom model development using Jupyter notebooks.
- **SageMaker JumpStart** – Pre-built solutions and model templates for common use cases.

---

## ⚙️ 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

**Purpose:** Optimize model performance by finding the best hyperparameters.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning** – Searches for the best combination of hyperparameters using built-in algorithms.

---

## 📏 6. Model Evaluation

**Purpose:** Test the model's performance on validation or test data.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Experiments** – Track, compare, and manage model training runs and results.
- **SageMaker Studio Notebooks** – Visualize and evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

## 🚀 7. Model Deployment

**Purpose:** Make the trained model available for real-time or batch inference.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Endpoints** – Deploy models as real-time APIs.
- **SageMaker Batch Transform** – Perform batch inference on large datasets.
- **Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference** – Automatically scales and shuts down when not in use.
- **Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoint** – Host multiple models on a single endpoint to reduce cost.

---

## 📡 8. Model Monitoring

**Purpose:** Monitor model performance in production and detect issues.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor** – Detect data drift, prediction skew, and quality issues in real-time.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Collect logs and metrics for deployed models and services.
- **AWS CloudTrail** – Track API calls and audit model access or changes.
