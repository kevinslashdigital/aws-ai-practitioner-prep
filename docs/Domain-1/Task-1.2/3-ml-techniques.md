# Selecting the Right ML Techniques for Use Cases (Based on AWS Best Practices)

AWS recommends choosing ML techniques based on your business goal and the type of data you have. Here's how to select the right approach:

---

## üéØ 1. Regression ‚Äì Predicting a Number

**Technique:** Regression  
**Goal:** Predict a continuous numeric value.

**Examples:**
- Predicting house prices based on size and location.
- Estimating delivery times.
- Forecasting sales or demand.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner (regression mode)
- XGBoost
- Forecasting tools like Amazon Forecast

---

## üßæ 2. Classification ‚Äì Categorizing Data

**Technique:** Classification  
**Goal:** Predict a discrete label or category.

**Examples:**
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Predicting whether a customer will churn (yes/no).
- Identifying disease types from symptoms.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon SageMaker XGBoost
- SageMaker Autopilot
- SageMaker Clarify (for bias/fairness in classification)

---

## üìä 3. Clustering ‚Äì Grouping Similar Data

**Technique:** Clustering  
**Goal:** Find natural groupings in unlabeled data.

**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation.
- Market basket analysis.
- Grouping news articles by topic.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon SageMaker K-Means
- SageMaker Ground Truth (to label data after clustering)

---

## üïí 4. Time Series Forecasting

**Technique:** Time Series Forecasting  
**Goal:** Predict future values based on historical trends.

**Examples:**
- Forecasting retail sales or inventory demand.
- Energy usage predictions.
- Website traffic predictions.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon Forecast
- Amazon SageMaker DeepAR

---

## üß† 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Technique:** NLP with classification or sequence models  
**Goal:** Understand or generate text.

**Examples:**
- Sentiment analysis of reviews.
- Chatbot question answering.
- Named entity recognition (e.g., extract names/locations).

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon Comprehend
- Amazon SageMaker with Hugging Face models
- Amazon Bedrock (for LLMs)

---

## üñºÔ∏è 6. Image Analysis

**Technique:** Computer Vision (Classification, Detection, Segmentation)  
**Goal:** Analyze visual content.

**Examples:**
- Detecting objects in security footage.
- Classifying defects in manufacturing.
- Face detection in social media apps.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon Rekognition
- Amazon SageMaker + image classification algorithms
- Amazon Lookout for Vision

---

## üéÆ 7. Anomaly Detection

**Technique:** Anomaly detection (unsupervised or semi-supervised)  
**Goal:** Detect unusual behavior or patterns.

**Examples:**
- Fraud detection in banking.
- Equipment failure prediction.
- Intrusion detection in cybersecurity.

**AWS Services/Tools:**
- Amazon Lookout for Metrics
- Amazon SageMaker Random Cut Forest (RCF)
- Amazon Lookout for Equipment
