# 🧪 Tools to Detect and Monitor Bias, Trustworthiness, and Truthfulness

Maintaining **fairness**, **reliability**, and **accuracy** in generative AI systems is a cornerstone of responsible AI. AWS provides tools and techniques to **audit**, **monitor**, and **improve** the trustworthiness of machine learning and foundation models.

---

## 🧠 1. Analyzing Label Quality

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Detect inconsistency or ambiguity in human-labeled data that trains the model.

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Perform manual reviews or inter-annotator agreement analysis.
- Use data labeling tools with built-in quality checks (e.g., Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth).

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ 2. Human Audits

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Conduct **expert reviews** of model predictions to detect ethical issues, unintended behaviors, or domain-specific risks.

### 🧪 Use Cases:
- Checking AI-generated outputs in medical, legal, or financial settings.
- Evaluating model behavior on edge cases or sensitive topics.

---

## 🧪 3. Subgroup Analysis

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Evaluate model performance across different **demographic or categorical groups** (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, language).

### ✅ Goal:
- Ensure fairness and avoid discriminatory behavior.

### 📊 Metrics:
- Accuracy per group
- False positive/negative rate comparison

---

## 🔬 4. Amazon SageMaker Clarify

### 🔍 Purpose:
- **Detect bias** in datasets and models.
- **Explain model predictions** using SHAP values.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Bias detection pre- and post-training
- Feature importance analysis
- Visual reporting

### 🧠 Example:
- Identify if loan approval rates differ based on gender or zip code.

---

## 📉 5. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor

### 🔍 Purpose:
- **Track deployed model performance** and detect data drift, bias, or quality issues over time.

### ✅ Key Capabilities:
- Custom monitoring schedules (e.g., hourly, daily)
- Alerts when inputs or predictions change significantly
- Works with inference pipelines

---

## 👁️ 6. Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I)

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Enable **human-in-the-loop** workflows for reviewing model predictions when confidence is low or outputs are sensitive.

### 🧠 Use Cases:
- Content moderation
- Document processing
- Reviewing chatbot responses

### ✅ Benefit:
- Adds human judgment as a safety net for automated systems.
