# 🛠️ Tools to Identify and Enforce Features of Responsible AI

Responsible AI practices can be supported with **automated tools** that help developers detect and control issues like bias, toxicity, hallucinations, or harmful content. AWS provides native tools — like **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock** — to make this easier and more scalable.

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock

### 🔍 What It Is:
A managed capability in Amazon Bedrock that allows you to define and enforce **safety controls** and **responsible AI boundaries** for foundation models.

### ✅ Key Features:
- **Content filtering** for:
  - Hate speech
  - Violence
  - Sexual content
  - Harassment
- **Sensitive topics filtering** (e.g., politics, health)
- **Custom denied topics**: Define custom keywords or domains to block
- **Prompt and output monitoring**: Real-time safety check for each interaction

### 🎯 Use Case:
- Ensuring that AI-generated responses in a chatbot avoid unsafe, biased, or inappropriate topics.

## 📊 Model Evaluation and Monitoring Tools

### 🧪 Amazon SageMaker Clarify
- **Purpose**: Identify **bias** and **feature importance** during data preprocessing and model training.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Measure fairness across demographic groups.
  - Evaluate how much each feature contributes to predictions.

### 🧠 Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor
- **Purpose**: Continuously monitor **model drift**, **bias**, and **data quality** in deployed ML models.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Alert when the model starts producing different behavior due to changing inputs.
  - Detect unbalanced predictions over time.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Enable **Guardrails** in Bedrock for all production-facing GenAI applications.
- Use **Clarify** early in the ML lifecycle to detect training data bias.
- Set up **Model Monitor** for deployed models to catch drift or unintended behaviors.
- Apply **IAM permissions** to restrict who can use what model types and prompts.
