# 🧭 Processes to Follow Governance Protocols in AI Systems

To build ethical, secure, and compliant AI systems, organizations must adopt **clear governance processes**. These include creating policies, conducting regular reviews, implementing frameworks, and training teams. Effective governance minimizes risk, builds trust, and ensures regulatory compliance.

---

## 🛡️ 1. Define Clear Governance Policies

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Set expectations for how data, models, and AI outputs are handled throughout the lifecycle.

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Establish acceptable use policies (e.g., prohibited use cases).
- Create security and privacy requirements for training data and models.
- Include roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths in documentation.

---

## 📅 2. Set Review Cadence

### 🔍 What It Is:
- Conduct **periodic reviews** of AI systems, datasets, risks, and decisions.

### ✅ Examples:
- Quarterly model performance and fairness audits.
- Annual reviews of third-party foundation model usage.
- Monthly updates on data access logs or security events.

---

## 🧠 3. Implement Governance Review Strategies

### ✅ Techniques:
- Use **checklists and scoring rubrics** to assess risk across AI use cases.
- Involve **multi-disciplinary committees** (e.g., security, legal, domain experts).
- Require model cards and **model documentation** before deployment.

---

## 🔐 4. Apply Governance Frameworks

### 🔍 Recommended Frameworks:
- **Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix**:
  - A structured framework to assess the security needs of GenAI solutions across:
    - Data confidentiality
    - Prompt and model security
    - Output risks
    - Operational boundaries

- **AWS Well-Architected Framework – AI Lens**:
  - Aligns AI solutions with AWS cloud best practices for governance, reliability, and cost.

---

## 👁️ 5. Define Transparency Standards

### 🔍 Goal:
- Promote explainability, accountability, and ethical AI deployment.

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Use **SageMaker Model Cards** for documenting model intent, limitations, and training data.
- Require dataset documentation (e.g., datasheets for datasets).
- Implement explainability tools like SHAP or LIME.

---

## 👩‍🏫 6. Conduct Team Training and Awareness

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Ensure all stakeholders understand and follow governance protocols.

### ✅ Training Topics:
- Responsible AI principles and bias mitigation
- AWS security and compliance tools
- Regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, AI Act)

### ✅ Strategies:
- Create onboarding courses for new hires.
- Host quarterly governance workshops and simulated audits.
- Certify team members in AWS security or AI-specific compliance programs.

## ✅ Tips for Governance Success

- Automate parts of the governance process using tools like **AWS Audit Manager**, **SageMaker Clarify**, and **CloudTrail**.
- Document and version every governance review.
- Align governance with business outcomes to avoid being a bottleneck.
- Make governance **collaborative, not just compliant** — involve stakeholders early.
