# 🧾 Regulatory Compliance Standards for AI Systems

As AI becomes more embedded in critical systems, organizations must comply with global **regulations, standards, and laws** that govern how data is used, how models behave, and how ethical concerns are addressed. These frameworks ensure AI systems are **trustworthy, auditable, and legally defensible**.

---

## 🌐 1. International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

### ✅ Key Standards:
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information Security Management
- **ISO/IEC 23894** – AI Risk Management (emerging)
- **ISO/IEC TR 24028** – Trustworthiness in AI
- **ISO/IEC 38507** – Governance of IT including AI systems

### 📌 Focus:
- Data privacy and security
- Risk assessment and governance
- Transparency and robustness of AI models

---

## 🧮 2. System and Organization Controls (SOC)

### ✅ SOC 2 (Most Relevant):
- Focuses on **security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy**.
- Often required by enterprise customers when using cloud-hosted AI services.

### 📋 Applied To:
- AI platform providers like **Amazon SageMaker**, **Amazon Bedrock**, and **AWS overall infrastructure**.

### 🔍 Key Benefit:
- Demonstrates trustworthiness and internal controls for AI operations.

## ⚖️ 3. Algorithm Accountability and AI Laws

### ✅ Examples of Legal Standards:
- **EU AI Act (2024–2025)**:
  - Risk-based classification (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal)
  - Requires transparency, bias monitoring, human oversight

- **U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act** (proposed):
  - Requires AI impact assessments for automated decision-making systems

- **GDPR (EU)**:
  - Restricts automated profiling
  - Requires explainability and right to human review

- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**:
  - Data usage disclosures and opt-outs for AI-driven profiling

### 🧠 Core Principles:
- Fairness and non-discrimination
- Explainability and transparency
- Risk classification and management

## ✅ Best Practices for AI Compliance

- Use **SageMaker Model Cards** to document model usage and limitations.
- Design systems with **explainability and auditability** in mind.
- Perform regular **bias assessments** and human evaluations.
- Follow **data minimization** and **privacy-by-design** principles.
- Keep current with **regional AI laws** and global ethical frameworks.
