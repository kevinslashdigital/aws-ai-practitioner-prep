# 🛡️ AWS Services for Governance and Regulatory Compliance

Governance and compliance are essential components of building secure and trustworthy AI systems. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of tools to **monitor, audit, enforce policies, and maintain regulatory alignment** throughout your AI development lifecycle.

---

## 🧾 1. AWS Config

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Continuously monitors and records AWS resource configurations.
- Audits changes and ensures compliance with defined rules.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Detect non-compliant SageMaker resources.
- Monitor if encryption, logging, or access controls are misconfigured.

---

## 🕵️ 2. Amazon Inspector

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Automatically assesses **vulnerabilities** and **software dependencies** in EC2, Lambda, and containers.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Scan AI pipelines for security flaws (e.g., Python libraries).
- Ensure SageMaker endpoints are not exposed with unpatched CVEs.

---

## 📋 3. AWS Audit Manager

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Automates evidence collection for audits and compliance programs (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Generate reports for AI model governance.
- Maintain audit trails for data usage and system access.

---

## 📜 4. AWS Artifact

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Central hub to access **AWS compliance reports**, such as ISO certifications, SOC 2, and GDPR whitepapers.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Share official AWS compliance documentation with regulators.
- Confirm that services like Amazon Bedrock or SageMaker meet standards.

---

## 📑 5. AWS CloudTrail

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Tracks **every API call and event** across your AWS environment.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Audit who invoked a SageMaker training job or modified IAM roles.
- Detect unauthorized access to AI resources.

---

## ✅ 6. AWS Trusted Advisor

### 🔍 Purpose:
- Provides **real-time guidance** to improve security, fault tolerance, performance, and cost efficiency.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Flag insecure configurations (e.g., open S3 buckets storing training data).
- Recommend policy or quota adjustments to meet compliance benchmarks.
