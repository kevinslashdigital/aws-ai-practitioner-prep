# The similarities and differences between AI, ML, and deep learning. 

## üîó Similarities

| Aspect                        | AI, ML, and Deep Learning all...                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**                      | Try to make machines smart or capable of solving problems like humans.                    |
| **Data-Driven**               | Learn or improve performance using data.                                                  |
| **Used in Real Applications** | Power things like chatbots, self-driving cars, facial recognition, voice assistants, etc. |
| **Part of a Hierarchy**       | Are connected ‚Äî Deep Learning is a part of ML, and ML is a part of AI.                    |

## üîç Differences

| Feature               | AI                                                             | Machine Learning (ML)                                        | Deep Learning                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | A broad field that makes machines simulate human intelligence. | A subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data.      | A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers.            |
| **Examples**          | Rule-based systems, expert systems, smart robots.              | Spam email filters, recommendation systems, fraud detection. | Voice recognition (e.g., Siri), image classification, ChatGPT.        |
| **Learning Approach** | Can be rule-based or data-based.                               | Learns patterns from data using algorithms.                  | Learns complex patterns using neural networks.                        |
| **Human Involvement** | May need humans to program rules.                              | Needs data and training, less manual rule-setting.           | Needs large amounts of data and computing power.                      |
| **Complexity**        | Broadest and includes simple to very complex systems.          | More focused and requires statistical methods.               | Most complex, mimics the brain structure and needs powerful hardware. |
