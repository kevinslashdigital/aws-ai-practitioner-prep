# Basic AI terms

For example, [AI](#ai-artificial-intelligence), [ML](#ml-machine-learning), [deep learning](#deep-learning), [neural networks](#neural-networks),
[computer vision](#computer-vision), [natural language processing (NLP)](#natural-language-processing-nlp), [model](#model), [algorithm](#algorithm),
[training and inferencing](#training-and-inferencing), [bias](#bias), [fairness](#fairness), [fit](#fit), [large language model (LLM)](#large-language-model-llm)

## AI (Artificial Intelligence)

AI is when computers are made to think and act like humans. It helps machines understand, learn, and solve problems. For example, AI can be used in voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, self-driving cars, or robots that help in hospitals.

## ML (Machine Learning)

Machine Learning is a part of AI. It helps computers learn from data. Instead of being told exactly what to do, the computer looks at a lot of examples and figures out how to do a task. For example, a machine learning model can look at thousands of pictures of cats and dogs to learn how to tell the difference between them.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a special kind of machine learning. It uses structures called "neural networks" that are inspired by how the human brain works. Deep learning is very good at recognizing patterns, like identifying faces in photos or understanding spoken language.

## Neural Networks

A neural network is a group of connected "nodes" or "neurons" that work together to process data. These networks can have many layers — we call them "deep" when they have a lot. Neural networks are used in tasks like image recognition and language translation.

## Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of AI that helps machines "see" and understand images or videos. It is used in facial recognition, security cameras, and helping self-driving cars understand road signs or people.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP helps computers understand and use human language. It powers things like chatbots, language translation tools, and spam filters in email. For example, when you ask Google a question, NLP helps it understand what you mean.

## Model

A model is the result of training a machine learning algorithm on data. It’s like a smart tool that can make predictions. For example, a model can predict if an email is spam or not based on past emails.

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of rules or steps the computer follows to solve a problem. In AI, algorithms are used to process data and learn patterns. Different algorithms are used for different types of tasks, like sorting, recognizing images, or recommending movies.

## Training and Inferencing

- **Training**: This is when the AI learns from data. The computer looks at many examples and adjusts itself to improve.
- **Inferencing**: This is when the trained model is used to make predictions or decisions. For example, after training a model to recognize cats, it can now look at a new photo and say, "Yes, that’s a cat!"

## Bias

Bias happens when the AI makes unfair or incorrect decisions because of problems in the data or how it was trained. For example, if most pictures in a face recognition app are of one race or gender, the app may not work well for others.

## Fairness

Fairness means making sure the AI works well for everyone and does not favor one group over another. It is about building AI that is ethical and inclusive.

## Fit

Fit is about how well a model learns from the training data:

- **Underfitting**: The model is too simple and doesn't learn enough from the data.
- **Overfitting**: The model learns too much detail from the training data, including noise or errors, and doesn’t work well on new data.
- **Good fit**: The model learns just the right amount — it works well on both training and new data.

## Large Language Model (LLM)

A Large Language Model is a type of deep learning model trained on huge amounts of text data. It can understand and generate human-like language. Examples include ChatGPT and Google Bard. LLMs can write emails, answer questions, translate text, and more.
