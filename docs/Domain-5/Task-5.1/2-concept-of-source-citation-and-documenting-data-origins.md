# 📚 Source Citation and Documenting Data Origins

Understanding where data comes from — and being able to prove it — is critical for **trustworthy, ethical, and legally compliant AI systems**. This is often referred to as **data provenance**, and includes techniques like **source citation**, **data lineage tracking**, and **cataloging**.

---

## ✅ 1️⃣ Data Lineage

**What it is:**  

- **Lineage** is the record of the **complete journey** of your data and models — from raw data to features, to training, to deployment.
- It helps answer:  
  *“Which dataset trained this model?”*  
  *“Which code and hyperparameters were used?”*  
  *“What container image ran this experiment?”*

**How it’s done in SageMaker:**  

- **SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking** automatically builds a **graphical map** of your ML workflow.
  - It tracks processing jobs, training jobs, batch transform jobs, trial components, experiments, and their connections.
  - You can query lineage data, e.g., find all models using a specific dataset.

**Why it matters:**  

- Provides **clear traceability** for audits and reproducibility.
- Supports governance by showing every step in your workflow.
- Prevents “black box” models by recording exactly **how a model was built**.

## ✅ 2️⃣ Data Cataloging

**What it is:**  

- Cataloging means **organizing and versioning** all ML artifacts: datasets, code, container images, models, features, and more.

**How it’s done in SageMaker & AWS:**  

- **Datasets:** Stored in Amazon S3, partitioned with prefixes to uniquely identify versions.
- **Code:** Managed in repositories like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit, which automatically keep versions of your training and inference scripts.
- **Container Images:** Stored in Amazon ECR, uniquely identified by IDs and tags.
- **Features:** Managed with **Amazon SageMaker Feature Store**, which acts as a **centralized catalog** for feature definitions and metadata. It enables easy discovery and reuse of features across projects.

**Why it matters:**  

- Reduces duplication of effort.
- Speeds up experiments by making reusable assets easy to find.
- Improves collaboration among teams.

## ✅ 3️⃣ SageMaker Model Cards

**What they are:**  

- **Model Cards** are structured documents that **record detailed information about a model** — from development to deployment.

**What they contain:**  

- Intended uses.
- Risk ratings.
- Training details.
- Evaluation results.
- Other metadata important for risk managers, data scientists, and stakeholders.

**Benefits:**  

- Provide an **immutable, shareable record** for governance and audits.
- Can be exported as PDFs to share with regulators, partners, or internal teams.
- Support **transparency and responsible AI** by clearly communicating what a model does, how it was built, and its limitations.

---

## ✅ Summary

Together, **data lineage, cataloging, and Model Cards** form a strong **source citation framework** in AWS. They ensure that you:

- Always know **where your data came from**.
- Can prove **how your models were built and evaluated**.
- Can **reproduce results** confidently.
- Comply with governance requirements and manage risks responsibly.
