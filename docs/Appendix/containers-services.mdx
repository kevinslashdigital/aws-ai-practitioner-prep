  <summary> <strong>Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)</strong> </summary>

  **What it is:**  
  Amazon ECS is a **fully managed container orchestration service** that allows you to run and scale Docker containers on AWS without needing to manage your own servers.

  **Why it matters:**  
  - Simplifies **containerized application deployment**  
  - Supports **Fargate** for serverless containers (no instance management)  
  - Integrates with SageMaker, Lambda, and other AI pipelines

  **Typical Use Cases:**  
  - Running microservices for AI model inference  
  - Hosting REST APIs that wrap around ML models  
  - Scaling backend services that preprocess ML input data

  <summary> <strong>Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)</strong> </summary>

  **What it is:**  
  Amazon EKS is a **fully managed Kubernetes service** that lets you run Kubernetes clusters on AWS without manually configuring the control plane.

  **Why it matters:**  
  - Provides more **flexibility and portability** than ECS  
  - Allows you to run **AI/ML workloads using K8s-native tools** (e.g., Kubeflow, MLflow)  
  - Scales AI model serving and training pipelines using Kubernetes best practices

  **Typical Use Cases:**  
  - Running ML pipelines with Kubeflow on Kubernetes  
  - Managing multi-step model training and deployment workflows  
  - Hosting AI microservices using containers
