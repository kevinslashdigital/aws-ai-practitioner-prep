  <summary> <strong>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</strong> </summary>

  **What it is:**  
  Amazon EC2 provides **resizable virtual machines (instances)** in the cloud. You can choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU-based workloads.

  **Why it matters:**  
  - Offers **full control over compute resources**  
  - Supports **AI/ML training and inference using GPU instances**  
  - Scales from small experiments to high-performance distributed training

  **Typical Use Cases:**  
  - Running deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch on GPU instances  
  - Hosting custom-trained ML models for inference  
  - Performing large-scale simulations or model training
