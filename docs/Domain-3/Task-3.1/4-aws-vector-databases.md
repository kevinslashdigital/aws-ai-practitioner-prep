# üì¶ AWS Services for Storing Embeddings in Vector Databases

When building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or semantic search applications, storing and querying **embeddings** (numerical representations of text, images, or audio) is essential. AWS provides several services that support **vector search and storage**.

---

## 1. üîç Amazon OpenSearch Service
- **Best For**: **Semantic search**, RAG pipelines, and real-time retrieval
- **Capabilities**:
  - Native support for vector embeddings using **k-NN (approximate nearest neighbor)** search
  - Scales easily with ingestion pipelines and search APIs
- **Use Cases**:
  - Document Q&A
  - Product recommendations
  - Intelligent chatbots

---

## 2. üß† Amazon Aurora (with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Best For**: **Relational workloads** that also need vector similarity
- **Capabilities**:
  - Use **pgvector** extension with PostgreSQL
  - Store and query embeddings with cosine similarity or dot product
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hybrid structured + unstructured data systems
  - Embedding search combined with transactional logic

---

## 3. üîó Amazon Neptune (Graph + Vector Search)
- **Best For**: **Knowledge graphs** enriched with vector embeddings
- **Capabilities**:
  - Supports **semantic search** and **graph relationships**
  - Integrates vector similarity within graph traversals
- **Use Cases**:
  - Recommendation systems
  - Context-aware assistants (e.g., users + documents + relationships)

---

## 4. üìÑ Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB Compatibility)
- **Best For**: **NoSQL use cases** and document-based architectures
- **Capabilities**:
  - Store and retrieve embedding arrays in JSON format
  - Pair with external vector libraries for similarity search
- **Use Cases**:
  - Chatbot history + semantic memory
  - Storing document chunks + embeddings

---

## 5. üóÉÔ∏è Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
- **Best For**: Developers already using managed PostgreSQL
- **Capabilities**:
  - Add **pgvector** extension for native vector operations
  - Ideal for apps needing tight integration with relational logic
- **Use Cases**:
  - Low-latency RAG apps with transactional requirements
  - Personalized ranking systems
