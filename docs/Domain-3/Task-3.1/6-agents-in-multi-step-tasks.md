# 🤖 Understanding the Role of Agents in Multi-Step Tasks

## 🧩 What Are Agents?

**Agents** are intelligent orchestrators that manage **multi-step tasks** by coordinating between:

- Foundation Models (LLMs)
- APIs
- External data sources (e.g., databases, knowledge bases)
- User inputs

They go beyond simple prompt-response interactions by **understanding user intent**, breaking it into sub-tasks, and performing actions to fulfill complex workflows.

---

## 🔄 Why Agents?

Foundation models (LLMs) are good at generating text or answering questions—but they cannot:

- Interact with APIs
- Retrieve real-time organizational data
- Make decisions based on current state or workflows

**Agents bridge that gap** by:

- **Decomposing user requests** into steps
- **Calling APIs** or **retrieving knowledge**
- **Combining logic + LLM output** to complete tasks

## 🧠 Agents for Amazon Bedrock – What It Does

**Agents for Amazon Bedrock** is a **fully managed service** that allows developers to:

- Build task-oriented assistants powered by LLMs
- Connect foundation models with real-time business systems
- Automate complex processes without retraining models

---

## 🏗️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **User Input** (e.g., “Book me a scuba diving trip in Phuket next weekend.”)
2. **Agent Invocation**:  
   The agent understands the intent and breaks it into steps:
   - Check available dates
   - Find packages
   - Collect preferences
   - Process booking via API
3. **Foundation Model Guidance**:  
   LLM interprets natural language and helps formulate intermediate questions or responses.
4. **API Integration**:  
   The agent securely calls external APIs or databases to complete actions.
5. **Knowledge Base Augmentation**:  
   The agent retrieves context from Amazon Bedrock’s knowledge base if needed.
6. **Response Generation**:  
   A final, context-aware response is returned to the user.
