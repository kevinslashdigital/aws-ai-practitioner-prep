# 🎛️ Effect of Inference Parameters on Model Responses

When using a generative AI model, you can adjust **inference parameters** to control how the model responds. These parameters influence creativity, length, and determinism of outputs.

---

## 🌡️ Temperature
- **Definition**: Controls the **randomness** or **creativity** of the response.
- **Range**: Typically from `0.0` to `1.0` (sometimes up to `2.0`)
- **Effect**:
  - `Low temperature` (e.g., 0.0–0.3): Deterministic, focused, and repetitive
  - `High temperature` (e.g., 0.7–1.0): More diverse, creative, and exploratory
- **Use Cases**:
  - Low temp: Legal, technical, or safety-critical answers
  - High temp: Creative writing, brainstorming

---

## ✂️ Max Tokens (Output Length)
- **Definition**: The **maximum number of tokens** the model is allowed to generate in the response.
- **Impact**:
  - Limits verbosity and ensures cost control
  - Too small may truncate the answer
- **Best Practice**: Set based on the complexity of expected output (e.g., summary vs. essay)

---

## 📥 Input Length (Context Window)
- **Definition**: The number of tokens the model can accept in the **input prompt**.
- **Varies by Model**:
  - GPT-4: Up to 128K tokens
  - Claude 3 Opus: Up to 200K tokens
- **Impact**:
  - Longer input context enables deeper understanding and multi-turn memory
  - May increase latency and cost

---

## 🔁 Top-k Sampling (Optional)
- **Definition**: Limits the model to choosing from the top-k most likely next tokens.
- **Effect**:
  - Lower `k` = more deterministic
  - Higher `k` = more variation in output

---

## 🔀 Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)
- **Definition**: Selects from the smallest possible set of tokens whose cumulative probability is greater than `p`.
- **Typical Range**: 0.8–1.0
- **Effect**:
  - `Top-p = 1.0`: No restriction (most random)
  - `Top-p = 0.8`: More focused output

---

## 🔁 Frequency Penalty & Presence Penalty (in some models)
- **Frequency Penalty**: Discourages repetition of the same words.
- **Presence Penalty**: Encourages introducing new topics.

## 🧪 Example Scenarios

| Use Case            | Temperature | Max Tokens | Notes                               |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Technical Answer     | 0.2         | 300        | Precise, accurate                   |
| Creative Story       | 0.9         | 500        | Diverse, imaginative                |
| Short Summary        | 0.3         | 100        | Focused, concise                    |
| Multi-turn Chat      | 0.7         | 200–400    | Balanced creativity and clarity     |

Understanding and tuning inference parameters helps you achieve better control over **response quality, consistency, and cost**.
