# ðŸ§  Techniques for Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering techniques help you structure prompts to guide generative AI models toward accurate, relevant, or creative responses. Below are the most important techniques used in real-world applications:

---

## ðŸ”— Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- **Definition**: Encourages the model to "think step-by-step" before producing a final answer.
- **Purpose**: Improves reasoning and logical problem-solving.
- **Example**:
Q: If Alice has 3 apples and buys 2 more, how many apples does she have?
A: Let's think step by step. Alice starts with 3 apples. She buys 2 more. 3 + 2 = 5. So the answer is 5.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Zero-Shot Prompting
- **Definition**: Ask the model to perform a task **without providing any examples**.
- **Purpose**: Test the modelâ€™s general understanding of the task.
- **Example**:
Translate this sentence to Spanish: "Where is the train station?"

---

## ðŸŸ  One-Shot (Single-Shot) Prompting
- **Definition**: Provide **one example** before asking the model to perform the task.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the task format while minimizing prompt length.
- **Example**:
Example: Convert "Hello, how are you?" to Spanish: "Hola, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?"
Now convert: "Good night"

---

## ðŸ”µ Few-Shot Prompting
- **Definition**: Provide **a few examples** of the task in the prompt to help the model generalize.
- **Purpose**: Improves model performance on unfamiliar or structured tasks.
- **Example**:
Q: What is the capital of France?
A: Paris
Q: What is the capital of Japan?
A: Tokyo
Q: What is the capital of Brazil?
A:

## ðŸ“¦ Prompt Templates
- **Definition**: Reusable prompt structures with placeholders for dynamic content.
- **Purpose**: Maintain consistency and reduce manual repetition.
- **Example**:
Template: "Summarize the following customer review: {review_text}"


---

## ðŸ§ª Combining Techniques
You can combine prompt engineering techniques for better results:
- Use **prompt templates** to structure **few-shot** examples
- Add **chain-of-thought reasoning** to improve factual accuracy
- Apply **zero-shot** for quick tasks without needing context

| Technique        | Example Count | Strength                         | Best For                          |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Zero-shot        | 0             | Fast, simple                     | General knowledge tasks           |
| One-shot         | 1             | Format guidance                  | Quick adaptation                  |
| Few-shot         | 2â€“5+          | Better accuracy, clarity         | Structured or ambiguous tasks     |
| Chain-of-thought | N/A           | Logical reasoning and math tasks | Step-by-step explanations         |
| Prompt templates | Variable      | Reusability, automation          | Scalable and consistent prompting |
