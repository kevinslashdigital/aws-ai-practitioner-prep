# 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 📖 Definition

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines a **retrieval system** with a **generative AI model** to produce more accurate, grounded, and up-to-date responses.

Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal training data, RAG allows the model to **“look up” external documents or knowledge bases** at inference time and use that information in the response.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Query**  
   → e.g., "What is the refund policy of our company?"

2. **Retriever (Search Engine)**  
   → Finds relevant documents from a knowledge base (e.g., PDF, website, database)

3. **Generative Model (LLM)**  
   → Reads the retrieved content and generates a natural language answer using both the prompt and context

---

## 🎯 Business Applications of RAG

### 1. 📚 Enterprise Knowledge Bases
- **Use Case**: Answer employee or customer questions using internal documentation.
- **Example**: “What is the leave policy?” → Retrieves HR policy PDF → Generates human-like response.
- **AWS Tool**: Amazon Bedrock + Knowledge Bases + Amazon OpenSearch

---

### 2. 💬 AI Customer Service Agents
- **Use Case**: Power chatbots with real-time, accurate responses from support docs.
- **Benefit**: Reduces hallucinations and improves first-call resolution rate.

---

### 3. 📄 Document Q&A
- **Use Case**: Allow users to ask questions about long or complex documents (e.g., contracts, manuals).
- **Example**: Upload a 100-page PDF, and the LLM extracts relevant answers using RAG.

---

### 4. 🔍 Internal Search & Semantic Query
- **Use Case**: Let employees search across reports, emails, or logs using natural language.
- **Example**: “Show me sales performance in Q4 for Southeast Asia.”

---

### 5. 🧠 Expert Assistants & Advisory Tools
- **Use Case**: Build GenAI advisors in law, healthcare, finance, etc., grounded in real-time or curated databases.
- **Example**: Legal assistant answers based on the latest regulations and internal templates.

## ✅ Benefits of RAG

- 📌 **Grounded outputs** — less hallucination
- 🧠 **Domain-specific** — use your own data
- 🔄 **Real-time updates** — models reflect latest knowledge
- 💬 **Improved trust and explainability** — users can trace answer sources
