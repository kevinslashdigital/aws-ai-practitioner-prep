# ðŸ§  Key Elements of Training a Foundation Model

![Choosing Model Deployment Options](./img/training-process.png)

Training a foundation model involves three main stages:

## 1. Pre-training

- **Purpose**: Teach the model general capabilities and understanding of human language and multimodal data.
- **Method**:  
  - Uses **self-supervised learning**  
  - Trained on vast amounts of **unstructured data** (text, images, audio, etc.)
- **Requirements**:  
  - Trillions of tokens  
  - Petabytes of data  
  - Millions of GPU compute hours  
  - Significant trial and error
- **Outcome**:  
  The model learns fundamental patterns and representations but is not specialized for specific tasks or domains.

## 2. Fine-tuning

- **Purpose**: Adapt the pre-trained model to **specific tasks** or **domains**.
- **Method**:  
  Uses **supervised learning** with **labeled datasets** to update the modelâ€™s weights.

### Variants of Fine-tuning:

- **Instruction-based Fine-tuning**  
  Uses labeled examples for task-specific improvements.

- **Domain Adaptation**  
  Uses domain-specific data to help the model understand specialized language or terminology.

- **Multitask Fine-tuning**  
  Trains on examples from multiple tasks (e.g., summarization, translation, reviews).  
  Helps the model generalize and **mitigates catastrophic forgetting**.

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**  
  Updates only small, task-specific layers, preserving original weights.  
  - Example: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** â€“ Inserts low-rank matrices into transformer layers.

- **Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT)**  
  Keeps the base model frozen and learns task-specific interventions on hidden representations.

### Considerations:

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**:  
  Fine-tuning on a single task may degrade performance on other tasks.

## 3. Continuous Pre-training

- **Purpose**: Extend the modelâ€™s training with **new general data** to improve generalization or keep it up to date.
- **Method**:  
  Continues the original pre-training process, often on a broader or refreshed dataset.
- **Benefit**:  
  Enhances the modelâ€™s foundational knowledge without focusing on a specific task or domain.

Each stage builds upon the previous one â€” from general understanding (**Pre-training**) to task specialization (**Fine-tuning**) to refinement and updates (**Continuous Pre-training**).
