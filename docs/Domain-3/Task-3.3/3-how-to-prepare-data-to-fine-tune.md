# 📂 Preparing Data to Fine-Tune a Foundation Model

High-quality data is the foundation of effective fine-tuning. Properly preparing and governing your dataset ensures the model learns the right patterns, improves accuracy, and reduces risk.

---

## 🧹 1. Data Curation

### 🔍 Definition

- The process of **collecting, filtering, and organizing** the data needed for training.

### ✅ Best Practices

- Remove duplicates, noise, or irrelevant entries.
- Normalize formats (e.g., consistent punctuation, structure).
- Ensure balance across topics, categories, or user groups.

---

## 🔐 2. Data Governance

### 🔍 Definition

- Implementing **controls and policies** to ensure data usage is secure, ethical, and compliant.

### ✅ Considerations

- Anonymize or redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulations.
- Track data lineage and versioning.

---

## 📦 3. Dataset Size

### 🔍 Guidance

- More data is generally better, but **quality outweighs quantity**.
- Start with **a few thousand high-quality examples** for narrow domains.
- Large foundation models benefit from hundreds of thousands to millions of examples during fine-tuning.

---

## 🏷️ 4. Data Labeling

### 🔍 Definition

- Tagging data with correct outputs (labels) for supervised learning.

### ✅ Examples

- Text classification → sentiment = "positive"
- Question answering → correct answer span
- Chatbot → instruction/response pairings

### 🧰 Tools

- Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
- Open-source labeling tools like Label Studio

---

## 🌍 5. Representativeness

### 🔍 Importance

- Your dataset should **reflect the domain, language, tone, and diversity** of your real-world use case.

### ✅ Tips

- Include examples from all user types and edge cases.
- Balance between formal/informal, long/short, and structured/unstructured inputs.
